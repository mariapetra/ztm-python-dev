# imagine you have a shopping folder:

# shopping
#     - shoppingcart.py

# a package is simply a folder containing modules
# so when we import from a package we say:
# packagename.module

import shopping.shopping_cart

# see main.py
one rule of a package is at the root you need an __init__.py
