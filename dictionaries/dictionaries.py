# a dictonary is a data structure (a way for us to organise our data with some pros and cons to access)

dict

dictionary = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
}

# key : value

print(dictionary["b"])
# will print 2

# dictionary = unordered key value pair - as long as you know the key you give that and the computer will know where to look

# data structures are containers around data
# so they can be anything you want string/int/bool
