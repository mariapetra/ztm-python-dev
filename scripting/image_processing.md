what is it?

its something that happens alot - eg instagram - you upload your pics and instagram displays it
when you look at an image the image you see is not the one you uploaded
cropped and smaller
a/ save money / looks nicer / less storage space on their servers.
udemy - host all the videos / if in full format would cost fortunes so they compress the videos
