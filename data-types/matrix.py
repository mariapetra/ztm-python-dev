# Matrix 
# A way to describe two/multi dimensional lists

[[]] an array with another array inside of it

matrix = [
    [[1],2,3]
    [2,4,6]
    [7,8,9]
]

# why?
# This comes up alot on machine learning
# eg a computer doesnt know what a photo of a dog is
# a computer can understand an image based on pixels on a screen

eg pixels could be:

matrix2 = [
    [1,0,1]
    [0,1,0]
    [1,1,0]
]
# matrix[0] = first array
# matrix[0][1] = 0 takes the [first array] / [second item]
