# tuples are like imutable lists
# can be accessed through an index
# can do 5 in my_tuple

# why use? shows other programmers this should not be changed
# makes code more predictable
# but less flexible than a list - no reverse or sort
# however, they are fast
# maybe you could use for geograhic location

# a tupple is a valid key in a dict

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
new_tuple = my_tuple[1:2]
# is a way of copying only the items you want

# tuple has only 2 methods
# count counts how many of an item
# my_tuple.count(5)
# my_tuple.index(1) returns the index of 1
# len(my_tuple) returns the length
