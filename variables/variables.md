snake_case

lowrcase or underscore

__ = leave alone - do not use


assign multiple variables at the same time:

a,b,c = 1,2,3

Python square rackets work like this: [start:stop:stepover]
start at the first bracket/end at the last first : = stop second : stepover - = backwards :: = start stop -1 = fram back so ::-1 = reverse
