# strings are immutable = can not be changed
#  you can not change the value of the original string
# the only way you can is by completely reassigning the value

#  you could change it by doing:

selfish = "1234567"
selfish = selfish + "8"
print(selfish)
will print "12345678"
# a new string has been created the original has not been changed
