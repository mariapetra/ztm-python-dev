# an error that crashes our program is called an exception
# error handling - prevents our program from just erroring and crashing but handles them
# allows us to let the py script keep running even if there are errors

# some errors that exist

# common:
# type error
# syntax error
# name error
# index error
# key error - accessing a key that doesnt exist
# zero divisino error - cant divide by zero
