#### What is good code?

1. Clean - follow a style that the python community endorses

2. Readability - will you understand this 2 years later? will others?
    - names that make sense
    - add comments if required

3. Predictability - dont just try to look smart - have code that makes sense and does one thing really well

4. DRY - dont repeat yourself
