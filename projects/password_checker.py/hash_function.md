a function that generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets

it is one way - people cannot get what the input was

idempotent - a functoin given an input always outputs the same output

hash tables - give it a key and we know where it is in our memory

does it slow things down? - under the hood they are implemented with an optimal hashing function - big onation of o1
