#Truthy and Falsey

# what do they mean?
# underneath the hood python will convert things to booleans for your_Set

# truthy value = if we run bool type conversion it evaluates to true
# falsey '', 0 is falsey its not actually false but it runs as False

# eg if you write something with an empty string eg has password? then an empty string will show as false
