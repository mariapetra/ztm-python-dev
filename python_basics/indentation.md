Why indentation?

Py is unique becuse the indentation and spaces makes the interpreter see it and know it means something.
- it is not just for styling but the interpreter finds meaning in the spaces
python = clean and easy to read

in other languages you have something similar but usually you have some if statement and condition followed by curly brace
js doesnt care about the spaces
