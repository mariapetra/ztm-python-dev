#What is OOP?

Objects have methods.

We can create our own objects with OOP

    - our own data types with different attributes and methods. Why is this useful?

imagine you are working for amazon, they decide to have delivery drones to move packages faster. As code gets bigger and bigger it becomes millions lines of code divided into different files. it is more complicated. how do we use it to make more manageable.

It is a paradigm. What is this? 

    - This is a way for us to structure and think about our code in a way that is easier to maintain, extend and write.

For the drone delivery we would break it up in to small objects that would represent the real world. eg an obj for the propellors to fly, another dev works on camera and vision, another creates claws to hold, another dev works on signalling. break up functionality in dif pieces that represent the world, dif objects that can be combined after. we can also use the same pieces on different technology. extend into dif objects.

Class keyword enables us to do that
