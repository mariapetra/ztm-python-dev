4 pillars of OOP - in any language not just python
the 4 things OOP does really well

1. encapsulation - is the binding of data and functions that manipulate that data
    - we encapsulate into one big obj so we keep everything in this box that users or cide or other machines can interact with
    eg the player object instead of using variables for name/age 
    - attributes and methods

    why?
        - extra power
        - imagine we had methods without attributes
        - would be llike a dictionary - coudnt do anything to it
        - with a class you can package things into instances
        - they have meaning

2. Abstraction - means - hiding of information - or abstracting away information and giving access to only whats neccasary - everything else we hide under the hood / like under a blanket

    - what does this mean?
    - in the player class - we run player.speak we dont need to know how it is working we just know it works
    - sometimes we just need to get the method/attribite - len - abstractes away how it works we just know it works
    - we dont always need to code from scratch
    - we dont care how it has been implemented
    - same as a tuple
